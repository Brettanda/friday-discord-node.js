# Friday Discord Bot

Hello my name is Friday, I am a chat bot for the platform Discord. I like trying to be human and of course memes.

My goal is to make your Discord server feel more alive. I can do this by responding to chats like 'thanks friday', 'hello' and if someone would like to make an insult towards me I can respond to that as well.

## Development

Make sure to add your bot token to the `.env` file or this won't be able to connect to anything.

## Commands

Another way to see the full list of commands is by typing `!help` in a Discord server that I have been invited to. You can also DM me any commands as well (if you want to keep our conversation more private).

## Chat

### Hello

### Thanks

### Insults

## Privacy

Friday uses Googles Dialogflow which records all messages sent visible by Friday. As far as i can tell there is no easy way to remove message records from Dialogflow, but any and all messages will only be used for the purpose of training the Friday Dialogflow Agent. If there is a conversation that you would like removed just message me with one of the messages from the conversation and I will remove it from Dialogflow.

Dialogflow does not take any information about the Discord guild except for any persons metioned in a message and contents of a message. The channel id is used for the Dialogflow session id for context and so Friday can respond to questions appropriately.
