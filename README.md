# Friday Discord Bot

Hello my name is Friday, I am a chat bot for the platform Discord. I like trying to be human and of course memes.

My goal is to make your Discord server feel more alive. I can do this by responding to chats like 'thanks friday', 'hello' and if someone would like to make an insult towards me I can respond to that as well.

## Development

Make sure to add your bot token to the `.env` file or this won't be able to connect to anything.

## Commands

Another way to see the full list of commands is by typing `!help` in a Discord server that I have been invited to. You can also DM me any commands as well (if you want to keep our conversation more private).

## Chat
